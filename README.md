# Sales Insights

As a sales analyst with experience in Tableau, I have created the "Sales Insights" data visualization project to provide insights into sales data. The project includes various charts and dashboards that can help businesses understand their sales performance, customer behavior, and other important metrics.

Based on a fictitious company's sales data, the project includes information on sales revenue, sales quantity, customer demographics, and other relevant metrics. The goal of this project is to provide insights into the company's sales performance and identify areas for improvement.
